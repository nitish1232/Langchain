Title: The Solar System

The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the eight planets, with the remainder being smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies.

The four inner planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—are terrestrial planets, being composed primarily of rock and metal. The four outer planets are giant planets, being substantially more massive than the terrestrials. The two largest, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; the two outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants, composed mostly of substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, such as water, ammonia, and methane.

All planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the ecliptic. The Solar System also contains smaller objects like asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. Most of these are found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, or in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune.

The formation of the Solar System began 4.6 billion years ago with the gravitational collapse of a small part of a giant molecular cloud. Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed.

Scientific exploration of the Solar System began in earnest with the invention of the telescope and continues today with spacecraft missions and space telescopes. Our understanding of the Solar System is constantly evolving with new discoveries.

Fun fact: Jupiter’s Great Red Spot is a gigantic storm that has raged for hundreds of years.
